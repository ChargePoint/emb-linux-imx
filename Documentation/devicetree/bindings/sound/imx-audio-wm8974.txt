Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8974 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-wm8974"

  - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - ssi-controller	: The phandle of the i.MX SSI controller

  - audio-codec		: The phandle of the SGTL5000 audio codec

  - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			  source. Valid names could be power supplies, SGTL5000
			  pins, and the jacks on the board:

			  Power supplies:
			   * Mic Bias

			  Board connectors:
			   * Mic Jack
			   * Line In Jack
			   * Headphone Jack
			   * Line Out Jack
			   * Ext Spk

  - mux-int-port	: The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)

  - mux-ext-port	: The external port of the i.MX audio muxer

Note: The AUDMUX port numbering should start at 1, which is consistent with
hardware manual.

Example:

sound {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-sabresd-wm8974",
	"fsl,imx-audio-wm8974";
	model = "wm8974-audio";
	cpu-dai = <&ssi1>;
	audio-codec = <&codec>;
	audio-routing =
		"Ext Spk", "MONOOUT",
		"Mic Jack", "Mic Bias",
		"Headphone Jack", "MONOOUT";
	mux-int-port = <1>;
	mux-ext-port = <4>;
	status = "okay";
};

sound: sound {
	compatible = "fsl,imx-audio-wm8974";
	model = "wm8974-audio";
	cpu-dai = <&sai0>;
	audio-codec = <&wm8974>;
	audio-routing =
		"Ext Spk", "MONOOUT",
		"Mic", "Mic Bias",
		"MICP", "Mic";
};
